# NVIDIA Libs

Release: 0.7.20  
Recommended nVidia proprietary driver branch 550+ for best compatibility with OptiX and CUDA.  

CUDA SDK >11.5 should now mostly be supported. There can still be missing functions  
Added CUFFT helper library for FFT functions when running SDK 12.3 and newer  
See https://github.com/SveSop/nvidia-libs#helper-lib-usage below for usage  

Older drivers that does not support SDK 10 and older may also fail/crash. Report any crashes with  
logs on the issue page. However these are highly outdated drivers in general and will probably not  
see too much attention in that regard.  

Create logs typically with: `WINEDEBUG=-all,+nvcuda,+nvml wine ./yourapp.exe > yourapp.log 2>&1`  
Also see notes about DXVK-NVAPI below for logging.  

Library contains:  
nvapi (dxvk-nvapi)  
nvcuda (staging)  
nvml (wine-nvml)  
nvoptix (wine-nvoptix)

## How to build  

./package-release.sh name destdir  

## How to install  

### Wineprefix  
You can install symlinks and dll-overrides to the libraries in your wineprefix like this:  
`WINEPREFIX=/your/wine/prefix ./setup_nvlibs.sh install`  

To uninstall:  
`WINEPREFIX=/your/wine/prefix ./setup_nvlibs.sh uninstall`  

### DXVK-NVAPI
Check out README file usage of DXVK-NVAPI.  
[https://github.com/SveSop/dxvk-nvapi/blob/master/README.md](https://github.com/SveSop/dxvk-nvapi/blob/master/README.md)  
Typical log level usage:  
`DXVK_NVAPI_LOG_LEVEL=none` (Default) No output.  
`DXVK_NVAPI_LOG_LEVEL=info` Informational output of function calls.  
`DXVK_NVAPI_LOG_LEVEL=trace` Detailed debug information.  

For misbehaving games that do not work too well with DLSS or otherwise do not work with  
the detected architecture, you can override detected architecture like this:  
`DXVK_NVAPI_GPU_ARCH=` with one of the following options:  

`GK100` (Kepler)  
`GM200` (Maxwell)  
`GP100` (Pascal)  
`GV100` (Volta)  
`TU100` (Turing)  
`GA100` (Ampere)  
`AD100` (Ada)  

Known games that needs override:  
Monster Hunter World : `DXVK_NVAPI_GPU_ARCH=GP100`  
War Thunder : `DXVK_NVAPI_GPU_ARCH=GP100`  
Ghost of Tsushima : `DXVK_NVAPI_GPU_ARCH=GA100`  

### WINE-NVML  
In order to use DXVK-NVAPI (NvAPI) with some extra GPU information (temps and the likes)  
you need to copy the NVML binaries to your wine binaries folder. You can do this by  
running the included nvml_setup.sh script. NVML is only available as 64-bit  
See the Readme_nvml.txt file.  

### Tests  
You can run tests of your adapter and functions by running the test case file:  
`WINEPREFIX=/your/wine/prefix wine bin/nvapi64-tests.exe`  

PS. You must install said libraryfile in your WINEPREFIX (see above)  

### Proton  
You can drop-in the libraries in Proton8 - Experimental or GE-Proton-8 or newer like this:
  
`PROTON_LIBS='$HOME/.steam/compatibilitytools.d/Proton-8.27-GE' ./proton_setup.sh`  

This will replace or add the libs to Proton for use with games.  
The installscript is no longer compatible with older Proton-6.3 or Proton-GE-6/7 versions.  

OBS!  
You can add:  
   `"DXVK_ENABLE_NVAPI": "1",`  
   `"PROTON_ENABLE_NVAPI": "1",`
to your user_settings.py script in the proton folder eg:  
`PROTON_LIBS='$HOME/.steam/compatibilitytools.d/GE-Proton-8.27/user_settings.py'`  

Or you can run the game with `PROTON_ENABLE_NVAPI=1 DXVK_ENABLE_NVAPI=1 %command%`  

Some additional tweaks may be required depending on game used and version of Proton.  

## Helper lib usage
To use FFT helper library `cufft64_11.dll` when running CUDA 12.3 or newer, simply  
symlink the binary to the same folder where the executable you are running like this:  
`ln -sf nvidia-libs-release\lib64\wine\x86_64-unix\cufft64_11.dll.so cufft64_11.dll`  
NB. You should probably make a backup of the original `cufft64_11.dll` in that folder.  
This however requires CUDA SDK 12.3 or newer to be installed on your system!  

Newest CUDA SDK toolkit can be downloaded here:  
https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads  

Some older SDK samples can be run by specifying LD_LIBRARY_PATH to the system folder  
where libcuda.so.1 and other libnvidia-xxx.so libraries reside. This varies depending  
on distro. Ubuntu typicall uses `/lib/x86-64-linux-gnu/` for 64-bit and  
`/lib/i386-linux-gnu/` for 32-bit.  

For instance to get the NVIDIA SuperSonic Sled demo to run on Ubuntu you can load wine  
with using `LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/lib/i386-linux-gnu:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH`  

## DAZ Studio

In case you do NOT use nvml (wine-nvml) library to emulate nvml.dll, DAZ Studio will  
show 2 "adapters" for rending. Choose the one that show your GPU name, and NOT the other.  

NVML can be installed by using the `setup_nvml.sh` script included in the package and for  
DAZ Studio is recommended.
